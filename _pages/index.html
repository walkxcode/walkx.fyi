<h2>Hey, I'm Walkx, a <span id="description">web enthusiast.</span></h2>
<p>
  Over the years, I have had the pleasure of working on a diverse range of
  projects in the field of technology. From coding and software development to
  hardware repair and building, I am passionate about all things tech-related.
  <br />
  <br />
  Currently, you have stumbled upon my personal website, a small corner of the
  internet where I share some of my projects and musings with the world. Here,
  you can learn more about my interests, see examples of my work, and get a
  glimpse into my thoughts on various topics.
  <br />
  <br />
  I invite you to take some time to explore the site and learn more about me. If
  you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
  I would be happy to hear from you and continue the conversation.
  <br />
  Thank you for visiting!
